# Blockchain in C++                        


## Project Description:

A Blockchain system created from scratch using C++ . The Blockchain will include all the properties of a mainstream blockchain featuring public key cryptography , hashing , transactions , block creation , proof-of-work implementation . The Key-technical implementations of my projects are -

     -> Hashing algorithms( SHA-256), which is used to generate a unique hash for each block based on its data and the previous block's hash.

     -> Public-key cryptography(ECC-Elliptic Curve Cryptography ), which is used to secure the communication between participants in the blockchain and to           verify the identity of participants.

     -> Consensus algorithms, Proof of Work (PoW) , which is used to ensure that all participants agree on the state of the chain and to prevent malicious         


## Instructions :
